# Project_Flashcards

## Summary
This project is part of my Thinkful Learning Process. This is a flashcard application for users to store decks of flashcards to be studied. Users can add and edit new decks, add and edit cards in each deck and use the application to study the decks. 

## Tools Used 
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- GIT

## Learning Objectives
- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

## Takeaways
- First project with full freedom to create from the start. Getting to draw it out on a dry-erase board beforehand really helped map out the project and was a good learning step for how developing an app has a lot of steps even before coding a single variable.
- The biggest challenges for me in the project were deciding where to nest each component to have it render properly within each route along with getting more practice writing asynchronous code as that is something I can still use a lot more practice in.
- Overall, I think this an application that I can continue to use during my time at Thinkful to help me study certain concepts and I will continue playing with the different features and design as a good practice method.
